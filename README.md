# Jigsaw-Toxicity-Classification

## Overview

This notebook presents an approach to classify toxic comments using a deep learning model, specifically focusing on the "Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification" challenge. The goal is to build a model that can identify various types of toxicity while mitigating unintended bias with respect to protected identity groups.

The solution employs a simple yet effective deep neural network built with Keras, leveraging TF-IDF vectorization for text representation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification** from Kaggle.

  * **Kaggle Competition Link:** [Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification)

The dataset contains a large corpus of online comments, labeled for various toxicity types (toxic, severe\_toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity\_hate) and includes additional columns indicating references to different identity groups, which are crucial for addressing unintended bias.

## Objective

The primary objective of this notebook is to:

1.  **Preprocess** text data for machine learning.
2.  **Vectorize** comments using TF-IDF.
3.  **Build and train** a simple neural network model to classify comments as toxic or non-toxic.
4.  Demonstrate a basic workflow for tackling large-scale text classification problems.

## Notebook Contents

The notebook is structured into the following key sections:

### 1\. Data Loading and Initial Exploration

  * Loads the `train.csv` and `test.csv` datasets.
  * Displays the first few rows and checks the shapes of the dataframes.
  * Identifies the target variable (`toxic`) and the input text (`comment_text`).

### 2\. Data Preprocessing

  * Handles missing values in `comment_text` by filling them with an empty string.
  * Splits the training data into training and validation sets (80/20 split).
  * Extracts comment texts for tokenization (`texts`, `texts_val`).
  * Extracts target labels (`y_train`, `y_val`).

### 3\. Text Tokenization and Vectorization

  * Initializes a `Tokenizer` from Keras.
  * Fits the tokenizer on both training and validation texts to build a comprehensive vocabulary.
  * Converts text data into TF-IDF matrices using `tok.texts_to_matrix(mode='tfidf')` for both training and validation sets.
      * **Note:** The `max_words` (10,000) parameter is implicitly used by the `Dense` layer's `input_shape`, suggesting a common approach to limit vocabulary size for TF-IDF.

### 4\. Model Definition

  * Defines a simple Feed-forward Neural Network using Keras's Sequential API.
  * **Architecture:**
      * `Dense` layer with 100 units, ReLU activation, and `input_shape=(num_words,)` (corresponding to the TF-IDF feature dimension).
      * `Dropout` layer (0.5) for regularization.
      * `Dense` output layer with 1 unit and sigmoid activation for binary classification.
  * **Compilation:**
      * Optimizer: `adam`
      * Loss function: `binary_crossentropy`
      * Metrics: `accuracy`

### 5\. Model Training

  * Trains the model using `model.fit()`:
      * Input: `x_train_tokenized`
      * Target: `y_train`
      * Epochs: 20
      * Batch Size: 512
      * Validation Data: `(x_val_tokenized, y_val)`
  * The training history (loss, accuracy for training and validation) is captured.

### 6\. Model Evaluation (Implicit)

  * The validation metrics observed during training provide an initial sense of model performance on unseen data. Further explicit evaluation (e.g., on a test set, using more metrics) would typically follow.

## Model Architecture

The model is a shallow, fully connected neural network:

```
Input (TF-IDF vector of num_words features)
   |
   V
Dense Layer (100 units, ReLU activation)
   |
   V
Dropout Layer (0.5)
   |
   V
Dense Layer (1 unit, Sigmoid activation)
   |
   V
Output (Probability of Toxicity)
```

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:

  * `pandas`
  * `numpy`
  * `scikit-learn`
  * `matplotlib`
  * `tensorflow` (and `keras` if not integrated)

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
```

## How to Run

1.  **Download the dataset:**
      * Go to the [Kaggle Competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification).
      * Download `train.csv` and `test.csv`.
      * Place these files in the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook.
2.  **Open the notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook jigsaw-toxicity-classification.ipynb
    ```
3.  **Run all cells:** Execute each cell sequentially from top to bottom.

## Future Work (Optional)

  * **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different numbers of layers, units, dropout rates, and optimizers.
  * **Advanced Preprocessing:** Explore stemming, lemmatization, and more sophisticated text cleaning techniques.
  * **Word Embeddings:** Utilize pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText) or train custom embeddings for richer text representation.
  * **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) / Transformers:** Implement more complex architectures like LSTMs, GRUs, or transformer models for sequence processing.
  * **Bias Mitigation:** Explicitly implement techniques to measure and mitigate unintended bias, as per the competition's focus (e.g., re-sampling, re-weighting, adversarial debiasing).
  * **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Perform detailed evaluation using metrics relevant to the competition (e.g., AUC for different identity groups, BPSN, BNSP).
  * **Submission Generation:** Create a submission file for the Kaggle competition using predictions on the test set.
